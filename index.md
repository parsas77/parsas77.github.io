## About Me

Greetings, my name is **Parsa Shafiekhani**, and I am a second year student at UBC majoring in Microbiology and Immunology. My goal is to become a respected and knowledgable physician that people could rely on. I am currently most passionate about human physiology and working with the Vancouver Community to create a better environment for seniors dealing with age-related issues. In my free time, I enjoy doing sports, reading and spending time with friends.

With an already solid foundation in human physiology, I am eager to learn more about the human body and its many secrets while contributing to the healthcare community. My volunteering and working experiences so far have developped my communication, time managment and criticial thinking skills.

## Volunteering in Health Care 

To become a well-respected and knowledgeable doctor in the community, I have spent much time volunteering with different people and in various fields. Much of my volunteering has been in-person, and thanks to that I have gained insight into some problems in our communities. The one that I have been the most passionate about is creating a safe, comfortable, and accessible environment for seniors dealing with age-related issues. I am currently volunteering at the Innovation in DEmenetia Care and Aging(IDEA) lab at UBC, assisting in projects that aim to resolve this issue.

## The Future for me

I am pursuing a B.Sc. in computer science. Afterwards, I am thinking of either becoming a software engineer or pursing a career in AI research. I love to code and learn about technical machine learning. In my free time, I like to think about the future of the world with regards to AI and I regularly keep up with recent tech developments.
